Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

I used this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I compared a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

I created a Logistic Regression model and fit it to the training data. Then, determined the model's score by using the score function and the testing data from the previous step. I did the same for a Random Forest Classifier and adjusted the hyperparameters as needed.
